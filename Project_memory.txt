PROJECT NAME: DocIntel / Cognitive Infrastructure

GOAL:
Build a professional-grade document intelligence system that becomes the grounding and memory layer of a future AI platform comparable in scale to Google/Facebook, but focused on cognitive infrastructure.

PHILOSOPHY:
Systems over hustle.
Infrastructure over noise.
Dignity over dependency.
Long-term compounding.

CURRENT STAGE:
Document ingestion engine.

COMPLETED:

Python installed

VS Code installed

Git installed

Virtual environment created

OCR engine (Tesseract) installed

PyPDF2, pytesseract, pdf2image, pillow installed

Hybrid PDF ingestion script works

OCR fallback works

Text extraction confirmed

CURRENT POSITION:
Between Layer 1 (Ingestion) and Layer 2 (Structuring).

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE:

Ingestion layer

Structuring layer

Grounded intelligence layer

Professional output layer

Interface & monetization layer

SHORT TERM FINANCIAL GOAL:
$1000/month by mid-late 2026, ideally starting around March.

MONETIZATION STRATEGY:
Private access, document processing service, later licensing.

LONG TERM VISION:
A personal intelligence platform with memory, reasoning, and agency.

USER PROFILE:
Quiet, long-term, system thinker, values dignity, avoids hustle and noise.
DOCINTEL PROJECT — STATUS NOTE (Jan 10, 2026)

Current Status:

Document extraction infrastructure complete: extract_documents.py successfully extracts PDFs, DOCX, CSV, XLSX → JSON chunks.

JSON outputs verified; CSV encoding issues handled (errors='ignore').

Virtual environment is set up and working; all required packages installed except gensim (skipped due to Python 3.14/Cython incompatibility).

Next Steps:

Activate venv and test summarization script (summarize_documents.py).

Upgrade summarization to context-aware, not limited to 5 sentences.

Begin interactive QA on document chunks.

Notes:

We are laying the infrastructure for a scalable, multi-format, cross-platform document intelligence system.

Goal: build tools that can eventually become a billion-dollar platform, capable of reading, understanding, and answering questions on complex documents.

Keep work step-by-step, prioritize reliability and quality over speed.

Reminder:

Save all work (Ctrl+S) before closing VS Code.

Enable AutoSave if desired.

Focus on clean, maintainable scripts — we are building the foundation for something huge.
